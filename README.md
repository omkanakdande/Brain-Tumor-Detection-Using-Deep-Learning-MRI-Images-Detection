# Brain-Tumor-Detection-Using-Deep-Learning-MRI-Images-Detection
Brain Tumor Detection Using Deep Learning (MRI + Computer Vision) is an AI-based system that analyzes MRI scans to detect and classify brain tumors such as glioma, meningioma, and pituitary tumors. Using CNN models, it automates diagnosis, improves accuracy, reduces manual effort, and supports early medical intervention.
